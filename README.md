# Multi-modal AI will make some things radically simpler

***For the end user*** ... who will have *even better things to think about in the future* than they do now.

## But how multi-modal transformer engines enable the simplicity will be necessarily complex.

Multi-modal transformer engines are really about grinding through much more data, much richer data, much more complete data ... with more sophisticated reasoning algorithms ... we don't have the memory or compute power to do this yet; but we can almost envision a world in which the next waves of innovations in information technology will make it possible ... we're still ten or twenty-five years or even fifty years away ... but a half century passes soon enough.

***E V E N T U A L L Y* the [DRAIN.tips ***inference engine***](https://github.com/DRAINtips) might make troubleshooting and fixing stuff ***seem*** simpler for the user [by comparison to how impossible that kind of thing can seem now] ... the inference engine will gather and validate data with all kinds of sensors, transfer the data to be processed in real-time while the DRAIN.tips LLM [transformer engine](https://github.com/creVassOrg/TransformerEngine) pre-digests massive amounts of the multi-modal data, which it continually LEARNS, and gives processed or tokenized data that relatively simple back to the inference engine to chew on and THEN finally [after a few seconds have elapsed] give the user A LEGITIMATE ANSWER, ie something that tradesmen and engineers have never been able to offer customers.

## But FIRST, it's about data wrangling and speed of communication 

... *between the user with an AI phone and the heavy machinery in the cloud* 

In other words, in order for to have the most basic, rudimentary semblance of something resembling a clue about what we are trying to build there ... we are FIRST going to need to ingest *and digest* a LOT of repositories covering the finer points of multi-modal data wrangling such as the [LAVIS](https://github.com/creVassOrg/LAVIS) Python library for Language-Vision Intelligence ... the [docarray](https://github.com/creVassOrg/docarray) Python library crafted for the representation, transmission, storage, and retrieval of multimodal data and the [jina AI pipeline](https://github.com/creVassOrg/jina) for multimodal data communications via gRPC, HTTP and WebSockets ... the [LiveKit Server](https://github.com/creVassOrg/livekit) scalable, real-time video/data for multi-user conferencing based on the [Pion WebRTC API, written in Go](https://github.com/pion/webrtc) ... [Pydantic](https://github.com/creVassOrg/pydantic) data validation using Python type hints based on the [FastAPI](https://github.com/creVassOrg/fastapi) web framework

*Optimizing the neurosphere of work involves improving the DEEP flow of the play of a riveting game.* **SIMPLIFICATION of impossibly tough problems is ALL in the mind.** Better theories come from taking away the noise, eg ***E = mc<sup>2</sup>***

The meta-point we're trying to make here is that developers will end up designing multi-modal LLM systems which are more or less constrained to produce designs which are copies of the CI/CD development and issue-driven discussion structures used by these developers ... which ultimately means that developers have to aggressively simplify, refactor and ditch much of the cleverness that clogging their codebases ... although at first we might need workarounds to get things to work; LATER, we  will be forced to admit that code does not flow ... and THE REASON for that lack of flow is that many developers start off with the mindset that it doesn't matter as long as something ships ... the clogged sewer drain scenario happens after years of trying to stuff *too much long hair featurebloat* ... 

## ... down the ol' ***GITPIPE***.

### Wait a sec! WTF is a ***GitPipe***?

Let's re-read [Git Branching](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell) with some additional focus on [Git Internals - Plumbing and Porcelain](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Plumbing-and-Porcelain) ... approach this whole thing from a different perspective, with some serious thought given to how we might reduce just shoving things down the gitpipe just because the thing will swallow anything we commit.

A ***gitpipe*** is nothing but a likely to be thrown away git ***branch*** that has been created for the sole purpose of staging a soft, mushy, still WORK-IN-PROCESS-EY ***commit*** ... we might want several ***gitpipes*** to hold several different ideas ... but the GOAL of the final master commit is a radically SIMPLER, SMALLER, TIGHTER ***commit*** that make future code more maintainable, more likely to flow. ALWAYS BE SIMPLIFYING the alternative ***gitpipes*** with an eye to selecting the very simplest, tightest, most solid code ... you don't want lots of hair or stringey fur in your code, because *you will get enough of that stuff without trying*.

### DeepGit is for unclogging clogged ***gitpipes***

HOW does the subconscious process things into a simpler concepts that the conscious mind insists upon making more complex ... what if we could use ML/AI to subconsciously simplify the code we write?
