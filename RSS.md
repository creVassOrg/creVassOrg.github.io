In *creVass.org-speak*, you might expect that the **RSS** acronym would stand for something like ***Ripe Shit Summary***.

But other people kind of expect people use ordinary things like either toilets or **RSS** acronyms the right way that everybody uses them, so, since we want our shit to flush downhill, ***"according to code"*** ... *so to speak* ... therefore, this page is where you might find Really Simple Syndications (RSS) feeds and OPML files from our favorite podcasts, blogs, and other sources.
