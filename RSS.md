In *creVass.org-speak*, you might expect that the **RSS** acronym would stand for something like ***Ripe Shit Summary***. But other people don't like that because they kind of expect that people will use ordinary things like either toilets or water heaters or **RSS** acronyms the right way ... that everybody else uses them. 

Since we want to flush our shit downhill, like everyone is supposed to do, ***"according to code"*** ... *so to speak* ... this page is where you might find Really Simple Syndications (RSS) feeds and OPML files from our favorite podcasts, blogs, and other sources.
