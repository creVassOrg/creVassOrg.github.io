We are building a "Theory of Inventive Problem-Solving" TIPS model to serve as a smartphone-based inference engine ... the app using this inference engine would also gather data, predominantly photos perhaps, for the purposes of documenting a particular homeowner issues and history of maintenance. 

The [DRAIN.tips](DRAIN.tips) inference engine will follow the form of AI similar to other large language models such as Llama 2 70B, Bard, Bing or ChatGPT. The difference is that [DRAIN.tips](DRAIN.tips) will be more specific to the kinds of needs for information experience by a particular homeowner. The general gist of our approach would be to complement other AI models, but to assure the homeowner of complete privacy with respect to their information, ie it would 180 degrees different than the intrusive robotic home intrusion systems developed by Amazon and others.
