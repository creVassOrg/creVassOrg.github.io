We are building a Deeply Recursive AI NeuralNet (DRAIN) using the Theory of Inventive Problem-Solving (TIPS) approach used in the contradiction matrix ... after we train the DRAIN model, with the large corpus of materials related to home ownership, the model will serve as a basis for smartphone-based inference engine [which will also collect additional data in order to keep training the DRAIN].

At first, the [DRAIN.tips](DRAIN.tips) inference engine will more or less follow the roadmap for AI development that has been used for other large language models such as Llama 2 70B, Bard, Bing or ChatGPT. 

The difference is that the DEVELOPMENT of [DRAIN.tips](DRAIN.tips) will be more OPEN ... while also being more specific to the kinds of needs for information and the frustrations experienced by homeowners. 

We cannot stress the need for OPENNESS and TRANSPARENCY in development enough ... and that includes taking measures to cultivate criticism and skeptical appraisal, especially by knowledgable ***plumbers*** in the information flow business.

The general gist of our OPEN DEVELOPMENT approach would be to complement and build upon other AI models, but to work harder at transparency on the development side, while being more secure and private on the end-user side, thus assuring the homeowner of complete privacy with respect to their information, ie OPEN development would 180 degrees different than the intrusive robotic home intrusion systems developed by Amazon and other proprietary systems that people should be extremely wary of.
