# Dig your well before you are thirsty

NOBODY else is going to do it ... if you don't want to take resposibility for it, you will end paying dearly for polluted water when you are dying of thirst. 

Give up your drinking and the other habits that are not really helping you ... try to make yourself a teensy bit more proficient every day.  

Curate, annotate and update list of materials ... use AI to help you do it, but make those list your own [for your own house]; learn prompt engineering to better use AI, but generally the best thing is to APPLY what you have found directly.

We are trying to build lists / directories of information to help us better prepared to tackle projects AND to hire competent contractors for the parts that can be better done by professionals who actually understand WTF they are doing ... you could use your process to develop your lists [or you could fork ours then make them your own].

Our process for developing lists is basically driven by the need to NEVER WAIT UNTIL AFTER WE DISCOVER THAT WE HAVE ANOTHER NEW PROBLEM ... *a person has to be digging his own well of knowledge several years before he actually feels a hint of thirst*.

MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE, we really develop our ability to find, curate and annotate information for our own needs ... in other words, WE NEED TO STOP BEING VICTIMS of incompetent contractors.

Our lists going to be far from exhaustive, but we have to start somewhere ... we are not trying to list every possible thing, but we are trying to list everything that we need to know to do a project ourselves or to hire a competent contractor to do it for us. To develop these lists, we resort to AI and materials already on the interwebs ... but a lot of that material will be flat out wrong or stupid or just intended to sell someone's half-assed, backward thinking solution.

We ***start*** with following:

* Safety training: Work in the trades IS dangerous ... wear pants; wear steel-toed workboots; wear the approprite kinds of gloves for the job; wear safety glasses ... PROTECT YOUR HEALTH FIRST. It's important to learn about safety procedures and regulations, such as proper ladder use and stability ...  electrical safety ... gas line safety ... and water and sewer safety.  You will not only NEED to have things like the approapriate PPE [personal protective equipment] and safety gear, but you will also need to know how to use the stuff properly. This should be common sense, but you will be surprised how many people are injured or killed because they just don't bother to use their safety equipment OR did not even bother to get their safety glasses.

* There are almost too many different online tutorials and videos ... except that if you watch a few of these, you will learn how to separate the wheat from the chaff. AFTER you become proficient in being able to spot the kinds of producers actually understand their trade, then websites such as YouTube and different online fora will be come useful. If you have not put in the time watching enough of the different providers, then quick search will just make you dangerous ... AFTER you are proficient enough to at least spot the idiots, these resources will actually offer a wide range of plumbing tutorials and courses ... *which also attract commenters who you will find immensely entertaining.*

* Books and tech manuals: If some publishing company has actually edited and published this content, it will generally be an order of magnitude more reliable than a YouTube channel.  If you actually want to learn things, there's no substitute for the oldschool professionally written, professionally edited, profitably published and widely sold hard copy technical printed book. There are many used books and shop training manuals [of the kind used in industry tech or vo-ag shops in high school] from outlets like ThriftBooks ... things like Scribd will have all kinds of pdfs of useful industrial tech/shop manuals ... there are also tech service manuals from manufactures sites ... there's really no shortage of available information that covers various aspects of plumbing, including installation, repair, and maintenance. And if you need supplies, you can look through a lot of material on Amazon [even if you prefer buying from your local hardware store or Lowes or Home Depot or Menards].

* Hands-on training: Avail yourself of your local community college or vo-tech school. Attend seminars, continuing ed night classes, workshops, and even little demo confabs, maybe organized by local tradespeople or a hardware store to continue your education and stay informed. Consider taking a plumbing or wiring course or workshop where you can learn hands-on from an experienced plumber or electrician, employed by your local community colleges or vo-tech school ... the money and time that you spend on such a plumbing course will be far less than what you squander on using an incompetent plumber or utilize some tradesman without having a clue of what you need to accomplish. 

* Apprenticeship: You can also learn plumbing by working as an apprentice under a qualified tradesman ... and if you have done this, you will understand why these guys are far from deserving any sort of mystique. If you lack hands-on experience in home improvement, you will PAY DEARLY to exercise your opportunity to learn from an incompetent idiot who causes more problems than what they solve.

* Practice, practice, practice: The best way to learn plumbing is by doing little stuff yourself. Start with small projects such as fixing a leaky faucet or installing a new toilet, and gradually work your way up to more complex projects ... you will alway discover in the course of doing this, exactly what you can solve yourself AND what you just don't have tools, patiences or craftsmanlike skills for.

* Join online plumbing communities and PARTICIPATE IN THE DISCUSSION: Joining a plumbing community or forum can be a great way to connect with other plumbers, ask questions, and learn from their experiences ... learn from the mistakes of others, because you will never live long enough to make them all yourself ... you will find that there really are solid professionals who are legit [*menschs*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mensch) or genuine [*boddhisattvas*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhisattva) who are willing to share their knowledge with people who are LEGITIMATELY willing to learn.

* Manufacturer's instructions: BE EFFING CAREFUL HERE. Many plumbing manufacturers do provide detailed instructions and tutorials on how to install and maintain their products, but increasing manufacturers do not actually provide useful information, but instead provide information that will lead you to be trapped into buying their NEW products.

* Code books: Used code books and things like Electricians Handbooks are a great way to acquire these materials for a NON-PROFESSIONAL ... professionals will need to stay kinda current with current materials, but the homeowner is not usually going to be dealing with current code, ie a recent revison is going to be *close enough* for a homeowner ... familiarize yourself with local plumbing codes and regulations, which can help you understand the requirements and standards for plumbing systems in your area.
