***If you wanted to suck up all of the utilitarian home maintenance / home repair knowledge from different corners of the interwebs, how would you go about it? ***

You might ask an AI ... the AI would probably recommend some sort of cliche suggestion such as starting with a search engine, but you would quickly discover that the biggest limitation of search engines is that search results are a reflection of who generates ad revenues for the search engines ... with LLM models, the limitation is a function which corpus of knowledge was used to train the model ... you can only get so far from Wikipedia. For example, try using Wikipedia entries, or the entire Wikipedia corpus, all of Shakespeare's works, all of the Classics and anything else you want to throw into the kitchen sink to unclog your clogged sewer line ... *that fount of knowledge is going to come dry ... or the opposite of dry.*

# Dig your well, or fount of knowledge, before you are thirsty for knowledge you need

*Do not expect that ANYBODY else is going to unclog your drain for you* ... if you don't want to take resposibility for unclogging it and accept the challenge to think about the root cause of clogs while the drain is open ... you will end paying dearly for something polluted when you are dying of thirst. 

We are not exactly ready to train our model yet ... and the AI folks are still working the bugs out of their AI stuff ... not to mention, GPUs/TPUs are still way too expensive ... but it's none too early for us to BEGIN assemble the curated [lists of AWESOME knowledge](https://crevassorg.github.io/Awesome/) [pertinent to the joys of home ownership, like clogged drains] that we will eventually use to train our models and develop some handy-dandy inference engines for making home ownership less of a chore ... relax and trust the ol' [creVass](http://crevass.org) -- we will get'r to [DRAIN](http://DRAIN.tips).
