Different heat exchanger technologies [most with long-expired patent protection from 50 or even 100 years ago] use twisted spiral pipes for high-pressure-C02-as-refrigerant counterflowing along and water pipes with thinner, higher-pressure CO2 lines running in grooves that are wrapped in spiral fashion around water pipes. There's nothing particularly magic about this design approach; it simple aims to increase disperse the molecules of C02 to better enable the transfer of heat energy from CO2 gas molecules through the tubing to the water along the heat conductive area to increase the molecule-to-molecule efficiency to improve the overall heat transfer efficiency.  

The reason that we don't just take this a step further and release C02 directly into water to for molecule-to-molecule heat transfer is that this produce some carbonic acid (H2CO3) formation as the high pressure CO2 dissolves in water which dramatically lowers the pH of the water, such that the acidic environment leads to corrosion of the heat exchanger materials, especially when the materials are not designed to withstand acidic conditions. Corrosion can compromise the structural integrity and long-term performance of the heat exchanger.  Of course, corrosion of the separated lines in the C02-to-water counterflow heat exchanger materials can also lead to similar, but smaller forms of carbonic acid (H2CO3) formation ... since, in practice the CO2 line might contain small amounts of  water vapor the water line might contain small amounts of C02 ... but, in practice, there will also be traces of OTHER contaminants, so designing-corrosion-resistance is part of material selection AND the two lines needs to be seal as tightly as possible ... even though both C02 and water are non-toxic -- it's that lack of purity in these lines, can only produce bad things.

When considering other manufacturable heat exchanger approaches for high-pressure CO2-water counterflow heat exchangers, several options come to mind:

1. Plate heat exchangers: These heat exchangers consist of a series of thin, corrugated metal plates stacked together. The fluids (CO2 and water) flow through alternate channels between the plates, allowing for efficient heat transfer. Plate heat exchangers are compact, easily manufacturable, and can handle high pressures, making them suitable for CO2-water applications.

2. Shell and tube heat exchangers: In this design, a series of tubes is housed within a cylindrical shell. One fluid (e.g., CO2) flows through the tubes, while the other fluid (water) flows through the shell, surrounding the tubes. Shell and tube heat exchangers are widely used in industrial applications, can handle high pressures, and are relatively easy to manufacture.

3. Printed circuit heat exchangers (PCHEs): PCHEs are highly compact and efficient heat exchangers manufactured using diffusion bonding technology. They consist of a stack of metal plates with chemically etched microchannels, which allow for high surface area and excellent heat transfer. PCHEs can handle extreme pressures and temperatures, making them suitable for CO2-water applications.

4. Microchannel heat exchangers: These heat exchangers feature a large number of small, parallel channels for fluid flow. The high surface area-to-volume ratio of microchannels enables efficient heat transfer. Microchannel heat exchangers can be manufactured using techniques like extrusion, brazing, or 3D printing, and they can handle high pressures.

5. Coiled tube heat exchangers: In this design, the tubes are coiled into a helical shape, creating a compact and efficient heat exchanger. The coiled geometry promotes turbulence and enhances heat transfer. Coiled tube heat exchangers can be manufactured using bending and welding techniques and are suitable for high-pressure applications.

When selecting a heat exchanger design for high-pressure CO2-water counterflow, factors such as pressure and temperature ratings, material compatibility, fouling resistance, and ease of maintenance should be considered. Conducting thorough simulations, testing, and optimization is essential to ensure the chosen design meets the specific requirements of the application.
