[Don't just EMBRACE the suck of clichés -- be exceedingly grateful to be alive in the Golden Age of Clichés](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/02/ai-chatbots-cliche-writing/673143/) ... and do not ***exactly*** believe ***ALL*** of what the doomsayers might say about [open source falling behind proprietary models](https://johnscontemplations.substack.com/p/the-state-of-ai-march-2024).  Of course, open source will not beat out the competition in the consumer AI-space; that space will be sort of winner-take-all, as search engines were.  Open source LLM models will succeed in some realms, as Linux did, maybe not in the dumbed-down consumer space of PC desktop apps ... but in the larger picture, where licensing is an impossible constraint to businesses and consumers without infinite bank accounts, the open source dev universe will thrive and even be *supported* ***to a degree*** by the biggest proprietary firms [who are trying to destroy their competitors selling solutions and competing with them in other realms ... it will be just like how Azure, AWS, GCP, et al all pretty much have to ensure that they have container-friendly and K8s-friendly environments or how Microsoft supports the [GitHub Dev/Engineering Octoverse](https://github.blog/category/engineering/) or how container-friendliness drive Microsoft to support [WSL2](https://github.com/microsoft/wsl) or [WSL3](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/windows-subsystem-for-linux-september-2023-update/) as Linux-based dev environments on Windows machines.
